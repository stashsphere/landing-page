StashSphere allows you to create an inventory of your tools, supplies
and materials.

All these **things** can be added to one or many **lists**. **Things** and **Lists**
can then be shared with other **users** on the same instance in defined levels
of exposure, from completely *private* to *friends of friends*.

StashSphere is free and open source software, built to protect your
privacy and ready to self-host.
